# Linked List

This directory contains my solutions and notes from the Linked List Explore Card on LeetCode. Linked Lists are a fundamental data structure that is crucial for understanding more complex structures and algorithms. This card will guide you through the basics of linked lists and their variations, and help you develop the skills to solve common linked list problems.

## Purpose

The content in this folder is designed to help you build a comprehensive understanding of linked lists, a key data structure in programming. Through this Explore Card, you will:

- **Understand Linked Lists**: Learn the structure and differences between singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Perform Basic Operations**: Master traversal, insertion, and deletion operations in both singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Analyze Complexity**: Understand and analyze the time and space complexity of various linked list operations.
- **Use Two-Pointer Technique**: Apply the two-pointer technique to solve problems like detecting cycles and finding intersections.
- **Solve Classic Problems**: Tackle common interview problems such as reversing a linked list and removing elements.
- **Gain Practical Experience**: Accumulate experience in designing and debugging linked list algorithms.

By the end of this guide, you will have a solid foundation in linked lists and be well-prepared to handle related challenges in coding interviews.

## Structure

The folder is organized by the chapters or sections of the Linked List Explore Card, with each section containing:

- **Solution Code**: The main solution file for each problem, written in C, Python, or both.
- **Explanations** (optional): Comments within the code or separate documents explaining the concepts, approaches, and reasoning behind each solution.
- **Exercises** (optional): Additional practice problems or exercises that supplement the main problems.

## How to Use

This guide is meant to be followed sequentially, starting with the basics and gradually moving to more complex topics. Review the solutions and explanations to reinforce your understanding. It's recommended to attempt solving the problems on your own before consulting the provided solutions.

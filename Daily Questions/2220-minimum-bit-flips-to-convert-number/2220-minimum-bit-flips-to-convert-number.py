class Solution:
    def minBitFlips(self, start: int, goal: int) -> int:
        """
        This function calculates the minimum number of bit flips required
        to convert 'start' to 'goal'. A bit flip means changing a '0' to '1' 
        or vice versa.

        The XOR (^) operation between 'start' and 'goal' will produce a binary 
        number where each '1' indicates a differing bit between 'start' and 'goal'.
        The number of '1's in the XOR result is the number of bit flips required.
        
        Parameters:
        start (int): The initial integer.
        goal (int): The target integer.

        Returns:
        int: The number of bit flips required.

        # XOR 'start' and 'goal' to get a binary number where each '1' represents a differing bit.
        # Convert the XOR result to a binary string using bin(), and count the number of '1's 
        # which represent the differing bits.
        return bin(start ^ goal).count('1')

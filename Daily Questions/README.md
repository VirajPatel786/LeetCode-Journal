# Daily Questions

This directory contains my solutions and notes from LeetCode's Daily Coding Challenges. These daily questions are a mix of different difficulty levels and problem types, designed to keep your problem-solving skills sharp and help you build consistency in your coding practice.

## Purpose

The content in this folder is focused on:

- **Daily Practice**: Encouraging consistent coding practice by solving one problem each day, which is crucial for improving problem-solving speed and accuracy.
- **Variety of Problems**: Exposing you to a wide range of problem types and difficulty levels, from easy to hard, ensuring a well-rounded preparation for technical interviews.
- **Skill Enhancement**: Building and reinforcing key programming concepts and techniques through daily exposure to diverse challenges.
- **Progress Tracking**: Keeping a record of your daily problem-solving journey, allowing you to track your progress and revisit problems for review.

## Structure

The folder is organized chronologically by date, with each daily question having its own subfolder containing:

- **Solution Code**: The main solution file for each problem, written in C, Python, or both.
- **Explanations** (optional): Comments within the code or separate documents explaining the concepts, approaches, and reasoning behind each solution.
- **Reflections** (optional): Notes or reflections on the problem-solving process, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

## How to Use

Tackle one problem each day, using the solutions provided as a reference if needed. Try to solve the problems on your own before looking at the solutions, and use the explanations to deepen your understanding of the concepts involved. This practice will help you build consistency and improve your problem-solving skills over time.

## Contributions

If you have suggestions for alternative solutions, additional explanations, or other improvements, contributions are welcome! Please open a pull request to share your ideas. Collaborative learning is encouraged to help everyone improve their coding skills.

Happy coding!

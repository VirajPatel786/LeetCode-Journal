# Difficulty Levels

This directory organizes coding problems based on their difficulty level, making it easier to focus on specific types of challenges as you progress in your problem-solving journey. The problems are divided into three categories: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**, with each category containing its own set of challenges.

## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to help you tackle problems of varying difficulty and steadily improve your coding skills. Whether you're just starting out or preparing for advanced technical interviews, solving problems based on difficulty will help you:

- **Build a Foundation**: Start with easy problems to understand basic concepts and algorithms.
- **Grow Your Skills**: Progress to medium problems to apply more complex techniques and data structures.
- **Master Advanced Techniques**: Challenge yourself with hard problems to refine your ability to solve complex, interview-level problems efficiently.

## Structure

This folder is divided into three subdirectories:

### 1. Easy

The problems in the **Easy** directory are designed to test fundamental programming skills and basic algorithms. These problems typically have straightforward solutions and are ideal for beginners or those looking to refresh their foundational skills.

- Focus: Basic loops, conditionals, arrays, strings, simple data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues.

### 2. Medium

The problems in the **Medium** directory require a deeper understanding of algorithms and data structures. These problems often involve more complex logic, dynamic programming, recursion, or efficient searching and sorting techniques.

- Focus: More complex algorithms, recursive solutions, dynamic programming, graph traversal, and optimizing time and space complexity.

### 3. Hard

The problems in the **Hard** directory are the most challenging and are typically seen in advanced coding interviews. These problems require strong problem-solving abilities, optimized solutions, and a deep understanding of algorithm design.

- Focus: Advanced algorithms, tree and graph manipulation, NP-complete problems, bit manipulation, and optimization techniques.

## How to Use

1. **Start with Your Level**: If you're a beginner, start with the **Easy** problems. Once you're comfortable, move on to the **Medium** and eventually the **Hard** problems.
2. **Solve Consistently**: Try to solve a few problems each day to build a habit of consistent practice. Aim to gradually increase the difficulty of the problems you work on.
3. **Track Your Progress**: Keep track of your solved problems. Revisit problems you find difficult to strengthen your understanding.
4. **Learn from Solutions**: If you get stuck, review the provided solutions and explanations to understand different approaches and best practices.

## Contributions

If you have alternative solutions or suggestions for organizing the problems better, feel free to contribute by opening a pull request. Collaborative learning and shared solutions are always welcome!

## Conclusion

This folder is designed to help you grow your coding skills step-by-step, starting with easier problems and working up to more complex ones. With consistent practice and problem-solving, you'll gain the confidence and ability to tackle even the most challenging coding problems.

Happy coding!

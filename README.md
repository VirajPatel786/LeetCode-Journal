# LeetCode-Journal

Welcome to my LeetCode-Journal! This repository is a growing collection of my solutions to various LeetCode problems. As I continuously challenge myself with new and diverse coding problems, this repo is regularly updated to reflect my progress.

## Purpose

This repository serves multiple purposes:

- **Learning and Growth**: Documenting my journey to improve problem-solving skills and coding proficiency.
- **Optimization**: Each solution is carefully crafted to be clear, efficient, and optimized for performance.
- **Reference Guide**: A personal reference for revisiting and reviewing coding techniques, algorithms, and problem-solving strategies.
- **Sharing Knowledge**: Open for others who might find these solutions helpful in their own learning journey.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **By Difficulty**: Problems are categorized into folders like `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard`.
- **By Topic**: Where relevant, solutions may also be grouped by specific topics or data structures (e.g., `Arrays`, `Dynamic Programming`, `Graphs`).
- **Language Specific**: Solutions are primarily written in C and Python.

## How to Use

# Explore Card Track

Welcome to the Explore Card Track! This track covers a wide range of fundamental data structures and algorithms, designed to help guide you through learning the basics step-by-step. Most of us start somewhere on this track based on our prior experience and skill level, and it provides a structured approach to mastering key concepts in computer science.

## Explore Card Track Overview

This image shows the roadmap of topics you can follow. Each block represents a key topic in data structures and algorithms that will guide your learning journey.

## Purpose

The Explore Card Track is intended to guide you through learning essential data structures and algorithms by breaking down topics one at a time. It introduces new concepts in a manageable way, making it easier to understand and apply these techniques to a wide variety of problems. The graphic in this folder shows the roadmap of topics you can follow, helping you avoid jumping into material that may be too advanced.

By the end of this track, you will:

- Gain a solid understanding of arrays, linked lists, hash tables, binary trees, graphs, and more.
- Learn how to implement and use fundamental data structures and algorithms.
- Solve problems using data structures and algorithms tailored to specific challenges.

## How to Use

1. **Topic by Topic**: For each data structure or algorithm, start by going through the tutorial material provided in the corresponding Explore Card.
2. **Solve Problems**: After completing the tutorial, go to the LeetCode problems page and choose 5 to 10 problems tagged with the topic.
3. **Study Tip**: Everyone solves problems at a different pace, so don’t worry if it takes you longer.
4. **Learn from Solutions**: Review the discussion section or the solution article to see if there are more efficient or elegant ways to approach the problem.
5. **Repeat for Each Topic**: Continue this process for each new topic in the Explore Card Track.

## Study Beyond Explore Cards

While the Explore Card Track is a great way to build a foundation, you should also explore other resources to challenge yourself. Try solving problems where you don’t know the data structure or algorithm ahead of time, such as participating in the Daily Coding Challenge, contests, or assessments. These will help you practice identifying the best approach based on problem descriptions and constraints.

## Conclusion

By following the Explore Card Track, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the most important data structures and algorithms used in coding interviews and real-world applications. 

Happy coding!

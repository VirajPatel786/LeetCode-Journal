# Recursion I

This directory contains my solutions and notes from the **Recursion I** Explore Card on LeetCode. Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science, and mastering it is essential for solving many algorithmic problems. This card is designed to help you understand how recursion works and how to apply it effectively.

## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to provide a comprehensive introduction to recursion. By the end of this section, you will:

- Understand the principle of recursion and how it works.
- Learn to solve problems using recursive approaches.
- Understand recurrence relations and how to model recursive solutions mathematically.
- Learn about **Memoization** to optimize recursive solutions.
- Analyze the time and space complexity of recursive algorithms.
- Gain confidence in solving problems recursively and applying recursion in an efficient way.

## Structure

The folder is organized by the chapters or sections of **Recursion I** Explore Card, with each section containing:

- **Solution Code**: The main solution file for each problem, written in C, Python, or both.
- **Explanations (optional)**: Comments within the code or separate documents explaining the recursive concepts, approaches, and reasoning behind each solution.
- **Exercises (optional)**: Additional practice problems or exercises that supplement the main problems, helping you to deepen your understanding of recursion and its applications.

## How to Use

This guide is meant to be followed sequentially, starting with the basics and gradually moving to more complex topics. Review the solutions and explanations to reinforce your understanding. It's recommended to attempt solving the problems on your own before consulting the provided solutions.

## Contributions

If you have suggestions for improvement, alternative recursive solutions, or additional resources related to recursion, feel free to contribute by opening a pull request. Sharing different approaches will enhance the learning experience for everyone!

## Conclusion

Recursion is a key concept that serves as the foundation for many advanced algorithms. By completing the problems and notes in this folder, you will develop a solid understanding of how to approach and solve problems recursively, as well as how to optimize recursive solutions using techniques like memoization.

Happy coding!

# Array and String

This directory contains my solutions and notes from the **Array and String** Explore Card on LeetCode. Arrays and strings are fundamental data structures in programming, forming the basis for many complex problems. Understanding how to work with these structures is crucial for solving a wide variety of coding challenges.

## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to provide a comprehensive introduction to arrays and strings. By the end of this section, you will:

- Understand the difference between a static array and a dynamic array.
- Be familiar with basic operations (insertion, deletion, traversal) in both static and dynamic arrays.
- Understand multidimensional arrays, especially 2D arrays, and their practical applications.
- Understand the concept of a string, how it is stored, and its unique properties in various programming languages.
- Apply the two-pointer technique to solve problems efficiently, especially those involving arrays and strings.

## Structure

The folder is organized by the chapters or sections of **Array and String** Explore Card, with each section containing:

- **Solution Code**: The main solution file for each problem, written in C, Python, or both.
- **Explanations (optional)**: Comments within the code or separate documents explaining the concepts, approaches, and reasoning behind each solution.
- **Exercises (optional)**: Additional practice problems or exercises that supplement the main problems, allowing you to further practice key concepts and techniques.

## How to Use

This guide is meant to be followed sequentially, starting with the basics and gradually moving to more complex topics. Review the solutions and explanations to reinforce your understanding. It's recommended to attempt solving the problems on your own before consulting the provided solutions.

This image shows the roadmap of topics you can follow. Each block represents a key topic in data structures and algorithms that will guide your learning journey.

## Purpose

The Explore Card Track is intended to guide you through learning essential data structures and algorithms by breaking down topics one at a time. It introduces new concepts in a manageable way, making it easier to understand and apply these techniques to a wide variety of problems.

## How to Use

1. **Topic by Topic**: For each data structure or algorithm, start by going through the tutorial material provided in the corresponding Explore Card.
2. **Solve Problems**: After completing the tutorial, go to the LeetCode problems page and choose 5 to 10 problems tagged with the topic.
3. **Study Tip**: Everyone solves problems at a different pace, so donâ€™t worry if it takes you longer.
4. **Learn from Solutions**: Review the discussion section or the solution article to see if there are more efficient or elegant ways to approach the problem.
5. **Repeat for Each Topic**: Continue this process for each new topic in the Explore Card Track.

## Conclusion

By following the Explore Card Track, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the most important data structures and algorithms used in coding interviews and real-world applications. Happy coding!
